            <h2>left</h2>
            <h3>The items are packed flush with each other toward the left edge of the alignment container. When the property's horizontal axis is not parallel with the inline axis, such as when flex-direction: column; is set, this value behaves like start.</h3>
            <h2>right</h2>
            <h3>The items are packed flush to each other toward the right edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis. If the property's axis is not parallel with the inline axis (in a grid container) or the main-axis (in a flexbox container), this value behaves like start.</h3>

            <h3>Behaves as stretch, except in the case of multi-column containers with a non-auto column-width, in which case the columns take their specified column-width rather than stretching to fill the container. As stretch behaves as start in flex containers, normal also behaves as start.</h3>

            <h3>The items are evenly distributed within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items is the same. The first item is flush with the main-start edge, and the last item is flush with the main-end edge.</h3>
            <h2>space-around</h2>

            <h2>space-evenly</h2>
            <h3>The items are evenly distributed within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items, the main-start edge and the first item, and the main-end edge and the last item, are all exactly the same.</h3>
            <h2>stretch</h2>
            <h3>If the combined size of the items along the main axis is less than the size of the alignment container, any auto-sized items have their size increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting the constraints imposed by max-height/max-width (or equivalent functionality), so that the combined size exactly fills the alignment container along the main axis.</h3>
            <h1>align-items: center;</h1>
            <h2>normal</h2>
            <h3>The effect of this keyword is dependent of the layout mode we are in:</h3>

            <h3>In static position of absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword behaves as stretch.</h3>
            <h3>For flex items, the keyword behaves as stretch.</h3>
            <h3>For grid items, this keyword leads to a behavior similar to the one of stretch, except for boxes with an aspect ratio or an intrinsic sizes where it behaves like start.</h3>

            <h3>Used in flex layout only, aligns the flex items flush against the flex container's main-end or cross-end side.</h3>
            <h2>center</h2>
            <h3>The flex items' margin boxes are centered within the line on the cross-axis. If the cross-size of an item is larger than the flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.</h3>
            <h2>start</h2>

            <h3>All flex items are aligned such that their flex container baselines align. The item with the largest distance between its cross-start margin edge and its baseline is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.</h3>
            <h2>stretch</h2>
            <h3>If the items are smaller than the alignment container, auto-sized items will be equally enlarged to fill the container, respecting the items' width and height limits.</h3>
            <h2>safe</h2>
            <h3>Used alongside an alignment keyword. If the chosen keyword means that the item overflows the alignment container causing data loss, the item is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were start.</h3>
            <h2>unsafe</h2>
            <h3>Used alongside an alignment keyword. Regardless of the relative sizes of the item and alignment container and whether overflow which causes data loss might happen, the given alignment value is honored.</h3>
